Implementation of RESNet Using CNN architecture

Residual Network (ResNet) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that overcomes the “vanishing gradient” problem, making it possible to construct networks with up to thousands of convolutional layers, which outperform shallower networks.

ResNet improves the efficiency of deep neural networks with more neural layers while minimizing the percentage of errors.
